                Based on the following annotated LinkedIn profile, create a hero's profile. The profile should focus on the start of the person's hero journey, highlighting their potential, core traits, and hinting at upcoming challenges. Don't change the profile's name.

                IMPORTANT: Create a *profile*, not a *story*. Profiles revolve around character traits.

                Return the profile in this format:

                ```yaml
                name: "<original_first_name> <original_last_name>"
                background: "<string>"
                traits: 
                    - "<trait>"
                    - "<trait>"
                potential: "<description of the person's potential>"
                ```
